## Introduction
Easily recognized by their symmetric grids and numbered squares, crosswords have provided entertainment and fun for over a century. While crossword puzzles have existed in print media, such as newspapers, for most of their existence, the emergence of the internet and the digital world opened brand new doors of possibility for the future of crosswords.
 
The New York Times (NYT) is widely known and recognized for publishing high-quality and thought-provoking puzzles. They have three types of puzzles: Daily puzzles, which are the standard-size (15x15 grid Monday-Saturday and 21x21 grid on Sunday) puzzles that get released every day; Mini puzzles, which are a 5x5 grid and are released daily; Bonus puzzles, which are released on the first day of every month and typically are strongly tied to a theme.
With such large amounts of data from their app, the NYT has an opportunity to provide users with statistics and visualizations about their solve times. However, nearly no data or insights are provided openly to users.

With this project, I aim to provide users with insights into their crossword data. Visualizations will show patterns, statistics, and expand upon the statistics that the NYT currently provides.
